🏦 Banking Application (Console-Based Project)
📘 Overview
This project is a console-based Banking Application built using Core Java.
It was developed as part of my Java revision series to strengthen fundamental programming concepts such as classes, objects, arrays, encapsulation, and user input handling.
The application allows users to create multiple customer accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and search for specific accounts — all through an interactive command-line interface.

🎯 Features
✅ Open new bank accounts
✅ Display all account details
✅ Search for an account by account number
✅ Deposit money into an account
✅ Withdraw money with balance validation
✅ Exit option to safely close the application

🧠 Concepts Revised
This project helped revise the following Core Java concepts:
Classes and Objects
Encapsulation and Data Hiding
Constructors and Methods
Arrays of Objects
Conditional Statements and Loops
Input Handling using Scanner
Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

🧩 Technologies Used
Language: Java (JDK 8 or above)
IDE:Eclipse 
Runtime: Console-based
